# Sorting algorithms

- ### Emplementation of different kind of sorting algorithms

- #### Here is what each file is doing

  - this repository implements multiple sorting algorithms.
  - all `<num> main.c` files are used for testing purposes.
  - all `<num>-<name>_sort.c` files are the sorting algorithms.
  - you can find each of the sorting alogrithms time complexity in `<num>-O` files.
  - `print_array.c` is used to print an array.
  - `print_list.c` is used to print a linked list.
  - all functions prototypes and header files are included and guarded in `sort.h`
